# Mapbiomas Annual land cover and use maps

## Description:

The Brazilian Annual Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Project is an initiative that involves a collaborative network of biomes, land use, remote sensing, GIS and computer science experts that rely on Google Earth Engine platform and its cloud processing and automated classifiers capabilities to generate Brazilâ€™s annual land use and land cover time series. MapBiomas Project - is a multi-institutional initiative to generate annual land cover and use maps using automatic classification processes applied to satellite images. The complete description of the project can be [found here](http://mapbiomas.org).

Other regions such as Pan Amazonia, Indonesia, Bolivia , Peru and others were spun out of the work in Mapbiomas Brazil and as such these are also included in the current release

Scale: 30 m to 10m
Data Type: Multiple raster datasets and types


# Areas of global conservation value

## Description:

A series of global priority layers are provided from the [NatureMap project](https://iiasa.ac.at/models-tools-data/areas-of-global-conservation-importance-for-biodiversity-carbon-and-water). These maps were created by jointly optimizing biodiversity and NCPs such as carbon and/or water. They describe on a continuous scale the amount of land area with the greatest upper potential value for expanding conservation efforts.

<div class="result" markdown>

    Conservation in this context should be interpreted as not prescriptive (e.g. specifically the establishment of protected areas), but rather means that a certain area harbour great biophysical potential for contributing to the conservation of biodiversity, carbon and water assets.**

#### Usage notes
The datasets cover roughly the period of 2015 to 2019 and with a spatial resolution of 10 km (50 km versions are available as well on the data repository). The datasets were copied over from the source paths to harmonize path and naming conventions within the community catalog and all dunder characters (double underscores __) were removed with a single underscore. Folder names were also split with a hyphen to separate the words like biodiversity-carbon rather than biodiversitycarbon.

* Maps are supplied at 10km resolution. Maps can either start from a blank state (ignoring existing conservation areas) or build on the global protected area network that was established in 2019.
* Different layers are available for obtaining either priorities for biodiversity only, or for biodiversity and carbon and/or water. A separate distinction is whether maps include stratifications by biome. For more details there please consult Jung et al. (2021).
* The ranks for each layer are area-specific and can be used to extract summary statistics by simple subsetting. For example: To obtain the top 30% of land area for biodiversity and carbon, one needs to create a mask of all areas lower than a value of 30 from the respective ranked layers.

| carbon                | Carbon was included in the prioritization and jointly optimized together with the other assets by giving it equal weighting (see manuscript) |
| water                 | Water was included in the prioritization and jointly optimized together with the other assets by giving it equal weighting (see manuscript) |

The layers can be navigated openly through a dedicated Earth engine app ([conservation importance](https://uploads.users.earthengine.app/view/conservationimportance)).Coarser grained versions at 50km are also available [see Zenodo data repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5006332) but not uploaded to Google Earth Engine.

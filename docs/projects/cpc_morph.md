## Description:

The Satellite Precipitation - CMORPH Climate Data Record (CDR) consists of satellite precipitation estimates that have been bias corrected and
reprocessed using the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Technique (MORPH) to form a global, high resolution precipitation analysis at a 25-km
(1/2-deg x 1/2-deg) spatial resolution updated daily from 1980-present. Data is reprocessed on a global grid with daily temporal resolution. You can
get [additional information here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/climate-data-records/precipitation-cmorph) or on [climate engine org page here](https://support.climateengine.org/article/55-cpc-cmorph).

```js
// Read in Image Collections and get single image
var cmorph_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/noaa-cpc-cmorph/daily')
var cmorph_i = cmorph_ic.first()

// Print single image to see bands
print(cmorph_i)

// Visualize precipitation for single image
var prec_palette = ["#ffffcc", "#c7e9b4", "#7fcdbb", "#41b6c4", "#1d91c0", "#225ea8", "#0c2c84"]
Map.addLayer(cmorph_i.select('precip'), {min: 0, max: 200, palette: prec_palette}, 'precip')

## Description:

### World Settlement Footprint 2015

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2015 is a 10m (0.32 arc sec) resolution binary mask outlining the 2015 global settlement extent derived by jointly exploiting multitemporal Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat-8 optical satellite imagery.

**The world settlement footprint 2015 is now available in the official GEE catalog and [you can find it here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/DLR_WSF_WSF2015_v1)**

The entire catalog consists of 306 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection, deflate compression) each one referring to a portion of 10x10 degree size (~1110x1110km) whose upper-left and lower-right corner coordinates are specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2015_v1_EPSG4326_e010_n60_e020_n50.tif covers the area between (10E;60N) and (20E;50N)].

Settlements are associated with value 255; all other pixels are associated with value 0.


### World Settlement Footprint (WSF) 2019

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF 2019) is a 10m resolution binary mask outlining the extent of human settlements globally derived by means of 2019 multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery.

The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles. Each tile is identified by the lower-left corner coordinates specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSF2019_v1_12_18.tif covers the area between (12E;18N) and (14E;20N)]. You can [download the files here](https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF2019/files/)

Settlements are associated with value 255; all other pixels are associated with value 0.

### World Settlement Footprint Evolution (1985-2015)

This repository contains the World Settlement Footprint (WSF) Evolution, a 30m resolution layer outlining the global settlement extent on a yearly basis from 1985 to 2015 derived by means of multitemporal Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 imagery.

The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles. Each tile is identified by the lower-left corner coordinates specified in the file name [e.g., the tile WSFevolution_v1_12_18.tif covers the area between (12E;18N) and (14E;20N)]. You can [download the files here](https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF_EVO/files/)

Values range between 1985 and 2015 corresponding to the estimated year of settlement detection, whereas 0 is no data.

#### World Settlement Footprint Evolution: Input Data Consistency Score

This repository contains the Input Data Consistency (IDC) score, which provides a suitable and intuitive measure that accounts for the goodness of the Landsat imagery used for generating the WSF evolution and supports a proper interpretation of the product.

The dataset is organized in 5138 GeoTIFF files (EPSG4326 projection) each one referring to a portion of 2x2 degree size (~222x222km on the ground) with an extra buffer of 0.1 degree to avoid any discontinuity between neighbour tiles. Each tile is identified by the lower-left corner coordinates specified in the file name [e.g., the tile IDC_Score_12_18.tif covers the area between (12E;18N) and (14E;20N)].
Values range from 6 to 1 with: 6) very good; 5) good; 4) fair; 3) moderate; 2) low; 1) very low. You can [download the files here](https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF_EVO/files/idcscore/)

## Earth Engine Snippet:

### Sample Code

The dataset is single value only with a value of 255 for WSF 2015 and 2019 and pixel values are 1985 to 2015 for the WSF evolution dataset.

```js
var wsf2015 = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/WSF/WSF_2015");
var wsf2019 = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/WSF/WSF_2019");
var wsf_evo = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/WSF/WSF_EVO");

# NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid)

## Description:

The NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid) dataset is available as either a daily (NClimGrid-d) or a monthly (NClimGrid-m) dataset.
The datasets contain gridded fields and area averages of maximum, minimum, and mean temperature and precipitation amounts for the contiguous United
States. NClimGrid consists of gridded fields covering the land area between approximately 24°N and 49°N and between 67°W and 125°W at a resolution
of 1/24 of a degree (0.041667°). The primary purpose of these products is to support applications such as drought monitoring that require time
series of spatially and/or temporally aggregated gridpoint values. Reliance on single-day values and individual points is discouraged due to the
significant uncertainty that is inherent in such a product, as a result of the spatial distribution of the underlying observations, differences in
observation time between neighboring stations, and interpolation errors. Spatial and temporal averaging tends to reduce the effect of these
uncertainties, and time series of such aggregated values can be shown to be suitable for climatological applications. You can find addtional information[about the dataset here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00332) and [climate engine org page here](https://support.climateengine.org/article/75-nclim).

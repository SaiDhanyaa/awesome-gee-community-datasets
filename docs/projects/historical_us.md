# USGS Historical Imagery Western US

## Description:

This dataset contains an imagery base layer representing conditions from the mid-1950s across the western United States. We sourced the imagery from over 160,000 aerial images in the [USGS EROS Archive](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-aerial-photography-aerial-photo-single-frames) taken between 1940 and 1970, with the median acquisition date being 1954. The imagery provides complete coverage for 17 western U.S. states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Explore the dataset visually through our easy-to-use web map application at [LandscapeExplorer.org](https://LandscapeExplorer.org).

We preprocessed the imagery in MATLAB to reduce image vignetting and improve image contrast. Orthorectification was performed in Metashape. The compiled imagery had varying Ground Sampling Distance values, ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 meters. The GEE dataset was written out at 1 meter GSD.

#### Additional Preprocessing
The feature collection had Dates in different formats everything from simply

<center>

| Format      |
|-------------|
| YYYY        |
| YYYY-MM/dd  |
| YYYYs       |
| YYYY-MM-dd  |

</center>

An approach was taken to convert and standardize these dates and add the corresponding dates as epoch system:time_start to features in the overall feature collection. This was then merged back into a feature collection with additional properties system:time_start, year, standardized_date. Based on the year metadata you can now get counts across multiple time periods I am summarizing a 5 year range distribution

|------------|------------|
| 1935-1939  | 2175       |
| 1940-1944  | 4380       |

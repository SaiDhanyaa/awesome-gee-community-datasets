## Description:

The Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at deterministic predictions of atmospheric elements
from the current day out to 48 hours into the future at a 10.0 km grid (1/11 deg) spatial resolution. The data for mean temperature covers North
America and is provided by the Meterological Service of Canada (MSC), a part of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The MSC provides
weather forecasts and warnings 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. MSC also provides federal department, agencies and other levels of government with
information to support emergency preparedness and response to events such as storms, floods, wildfires and other weather-related emergencies. You can find [additional information here](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-data/nwp_rdps/readme_rdps-datamart_en) and also on the [climate org data page](https://support.climateengine.org/article/83-rdps).

### Sample Code

```js
// Read in Image Collection and get first image
var rdps_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/ce-rdps-daily')
var rdps_i = rdps_ic.first()

// Print first image to see bands
print(rdps_i)

// Visualize temperature from first image
var temp_palette = ["#b2182b", "#ef8a62", "#fddbc7", "#f7f7f7", "#d1e5f0", "#67a9cf", "#2166ac"].reverse()
Map.addLayer(rdps_i.select('Tavg'), {min: -10, max: 20, palette: temp_palette}, 'Tavg')
```

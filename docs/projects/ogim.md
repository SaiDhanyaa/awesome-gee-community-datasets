## Description:

The Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping (OGIM) dataset, available in the Awesome Google Earth Engine (GEE) Community Catalog, is a comprehensive global repository of spatially explicit information on oil and gas infrastructure. Developed by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) (www.edf.org), the OGIM database is meticulously curated to facilitate the quantification and characterization of methane emissions from oil and gas sources.

This dataset is a result of extensive efforts at EDF, involving the acquisition, analysis, curation, integration, and quality assurance of public-domain datasets sourced from official government reports, industry publications, academic studies, and various non-government entities. The primary objective of the OGIM database is to provide valuable support for research and analysis related to oil and gas methane emissions. The dataset spans across the globe, offering a comprehensive view of oil and gas infrastructure.It provides detailed information on the locations and attributes of various oil and gas infrastructure types known to be significant sources of methane emissions. This includes data on oil and gas production wells, offshore production platforms, natural gas compressor stations, processing facilities, liquefied natural gas facilities, crude oil refineries, pipelines, and more.

## Description:

This dataset consolidates Google's V3 Open Buildings and Microsoft's most recent Building Footprints, comprising a staggering 2,534,595,270 footprints. As of September 2023, it stands out as the most comprehensive openly accessible dataset. Encompassing 92% of Level 0 administrative boundaries, the dataset is organized into 182 partitions. Each footprint is explicitly labeled with its origin, denoting whether it is from Google or Microsoft. Accessible in cloud-native geospatial formats such as GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, and PMTiles, this dataset provides a robust resource for various applications. Further details, including the dataset's comprehensive information and methodology, can be explored [here](https://beta.source.coop/repositories/vida/google-microsoft-open-buildings/description/) and [here](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2023/09/introducing-the-ultimate-cloud-native-building-footprints-dataset/), respectively.


#### Dataset Schema
Country level datasets were inegsted while each row in the dataset provides information on a specific building footprint with associated information on individual columns

* boundary_id (INTEGER): A unique ID linking the CGAZ level 0 boundary ISO to an integer, created for partitioning the datasets within BigQuery.
* confidence (FLOAT): A metric denoting the model's confidence about the accuracy of the building footprint. Microsoft-sourced footprints set this column to null since the original dataset doesn't feature this attribute.
* bf_source (STRING): Indicates the footprint's origin - Google or Microsoft.
* area_in_meters (FLOAT): Represents the polygon's area in square meters.

## Earth Engine Snippet:

### Sample Code

The datasets were collected from the country level geoparquet files and only a subset of these are mentioned below while an earthengine ls should provide more information on all countries ingested. All feature collections are in the format

projects/sat-io/open-datasets/VIDA_COMBINED/"3 letter country ISO code"

for example India would be

```js
var ind = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/VIDA_COMBINED/IND")
```

## Description:

This dataset including two contents including the validation datasets, only the location dataset has been ingested and the validation dataset can be downloaded. The location dataset consist of geocoded information on global offshore wind turbines (OWTs) derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series images from 2015 to 2019. It identified 6,924 wind turbines comprising of more than 10 nations. Data is available at 10 m spatial resolution, providing an explicit dataset for planning, monitoring, and managing marine space. The global OWTs are stored in Shapefile (.shp) format. The attributes and metadata are organized with referenced to the WGS84 datum, and each record consists of seven attributes: centroid latitude (centr_lat), centroid longitude (centr_lon), continent, country, sea area (sea_area), appearance year (occ_year) and month (occ_month).

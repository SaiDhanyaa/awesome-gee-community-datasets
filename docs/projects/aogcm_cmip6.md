# Current and projected climate data for North America (CMIP6 scenarios)

## Description:

Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) were developed to simulate climate variability on a wide range of time scales and are often tested in coupled simulations and data assimilation mode. You can [read more about AOGCMs and CMIP6 here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained). The datasets on this page have been developed by AdaptWest, a project funded by the Wilburforce Foundation to develop information resources for climate adaptation planning. The data were generated using the ClimateNA software. ClimateNA uses data from PRISM and WorldClim for current climate, and downscales data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) database corresponding to the 6th IPCC Assessment Report for future projections.

Ensemble projections are average projections from 8 CMIP5 models (table below) that were chosen to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. In addition to the ensemble projections, data are also provided from 9 individual AOGCMs (table below) that are representative of the larger ensemble. Nine individual models were selected to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. A broader set of 8 AOGCMs were used to create the ensemble data. Ensemble projections are also provided here for a greater range of time periods and scenarios than are the projections from individual AOGCMs.

#### Post processing for Google Earth Engine v7.3
* All of the 9 individual AOGCM models are added to the collection pertaining to each climate variable and named Climate-Models_(Variable Name). The ensemble models are ingested as along with the climate normals.
* Both AOGCM ensemble and individual models have date range and emission scenario type **emission_scenario** and **start** and **end** dates are added as property.
* Since the Climate-Models-(Variable Name) collection consists of 9 individual models another metadata field is added to those collections namely **model** to filter by model name.
* Since all Climate variables are monthly , an extra metadata called **month** is added to the climate normals, ensemble and the individual model collections for further slicing the data as needed.
* Version number for model and period for 20 year and 30 year monthly variables are now included in the metadata.

#### Known issues:
1. Some discontinuity in precipitation values occurs along the US/Canada border due to edge-matching issues between the PRISM data for the two nations.

2. Mean annual solar radiation (MAR) data are provisional and are slated to be revised in an upcoming release of the ClimateNA software.

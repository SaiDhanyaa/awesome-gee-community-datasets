# Global high-resolution floodplains (GFPLAIN250m)

## Description:

The GFPLAIN250m includes raster data of Earth's floodplains identified using a geomorphic approach presented in Nardi et al. (2006, 2018). The 250m floodplain dataset is derived by processing the NASA SRTM Digital Elevation model gathered from http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/, and in particular the 250-m SRTM version 4.1 DTM. The coding used for each continent and additional information are detailed in the metadata included in the GFPLAIN250m data repository. You can find the [dataset here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/GFPLAIN250m/6665165/1)

You can read the [full paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018309). The elevation data are processed by a fast geospatial tool for floodplain mapping available for download at https://github.com/fnardi/GFPLAIN. As per the paper, the GFPLAIN250m dataset can support many applications, including flood hazard mapping, habitat restoration, development studies, and the analysis of human-flood interactions.

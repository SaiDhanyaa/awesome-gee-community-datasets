# Global River Classification (GloRiC)

## Description:

The Global River Classification (GloRiC) provides river types and sub-classifications for all river reaches contained in the HydroRIVERS database. GloRiC has been developed by utilizing the river network delineation of HydroRIVERS combined with the hydro-enviromental characteristics from the HydroATLAS database and auxiliary information.

Version 1.0 of GloRiC provides a hydrologic, physio-climatic, and geomorphic sub-classification, as well as a combined river type for every river reach, resulting in a total of 127 river reach types. It also offers a k-means statistical clustering of the reaches into 30 groups. The dataset comprises 8.5 million river reaches with a total length of 35.9 million km.

You can find overall [technical documentation](https://data.hydrosheds.org/file/technical-documentation/GloRiC_TechDoc_v10.pdf) here and technical information for [GloRiC Canada here](https://data.hydrosheds.org/file/technical-documentation/GloRiC_Canada_TechDoc_v10.pdf)

#### Preprocessing

Besides the global version of GloRiC, there is also a regional version for Canada available, GloRiC-Canada, which follows the same classification principles but with Canada-specific adaptations. GloRiC-Canada categorizes all river reaches of Canada into 23 types.

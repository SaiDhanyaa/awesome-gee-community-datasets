## Description:

Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is a key variable in global climate studies. A global gridded dataset of daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) is particularly valuable and critically needed in the scientific and policy communities, but is still not available. In this paper, we developed a global dataset of daily Tmax and Tmin dataset at 1-km resolution from 2003 to 2020 through the combined use of station-based ground Ta measurements and satellite observations (i.e., digital elevation model, and land surface temperature) via a state-of-the-art statistical method named Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP).

This gridded 1 km resolution global (50°?S ~79°?N) daily maximum and minimum near-surface air temperature dataset (2003 ?? 2020) was generated using a seamless 1 km resolution land surface temperature dataset (2003-2020), a 30-arc second (~1 km) resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data, and air temperature observations at weather stations and a spatially varying coefficient model with sign preservation (SVCM-SP) algorithm. The gridded air temperature dataset is of great use in global studies of urban, climate, and hydrology.

#### Data preprocessing
The datasets were generated regionally and for tmax and tmin. The tmax and tmin were combined into a single collection for the regions generated. Additional metadata called "prop_type" was added to allow for filtering along with other metadata like the day of year and the actual date information for date based filtering. The datasets were projected to EPSG 4326 before being ingested to Google Earth Engine.

# Global Forest Management dataset 2015

## Description:

The global forest management dataset was published by Lesiv et al. (2022) in [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01332-3). The resultant map at 100m resolution detials six global forest management categories, including 1) naturally regenerating forest without any signs of human activities, 2) naturally regenerating forest with signs of human activities, 3) planted forest, 4) short rotation plantations for timber, 5) oil palm plantations, and 6) agroforestry. The dataset included reference dataset of 226 K unique locations through a series of expert and crowdsourcing campaigns using Geo-Wiki.

Some of the published dataset included here are

* A 100m forest management map
* Predicted class probability from a Random Forest classification
* Validation data
* Original crowd-sourced data

Some of the fields were encoded to remove special characters and renamed for clarity.

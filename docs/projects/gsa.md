# Global Solar Atlas Datasets

## Description:

The current version of Global Solar Atlas is v 2.6 released in July 2021. The Global Solar Atlas version 2.0 is an enhancement of the online platform, originally published in 2016 in version 1.0, that offers access to data needed for preliminary assessment of solar energy projects and sites through use of GIS data layers and maps in Download section. This Technical report summarizes delivery of the GSA 2.0 version and compares version 2.0 with previous version 1.0 in terms of enhancement in methodology, data layers and Solargis approach to PV electricity simulation. GSA 2.0 provides an access to long-term averaged yearly (for selected parameters monthly) solar, air temperature, PV power potential data and map products for almost any site on Earth.

The atlas provides an access to long-term averaged yearly (for selected parameters monthly) solar, air temperature,
PV power potential data and map products for almost any site on Earth.

#### Data Structure

Delivered GIS data include eight parameters in the form of a raster data layers, providing the information on solar
resource, photovoltaic power potential, air temperature and terrain elevation on global scale

Data layers are provided in Geographical coordinate system (EPSG:4326) and calculated in 30 arc-sec (nominally 1
km) resolution. On top of this, for more detailed analysis solar resource data (GHI, DIF, GTI and DNI) is also provided
in 9 arc-sec (nominally 250 m) resolution. Finally, auxiliary data layer of Optimum angle features with 2 arcmin
(nominally 4 km)resolution.

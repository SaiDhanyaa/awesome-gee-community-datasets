# Forecast Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (FRET)

## Description:

The National Weather Service is now producing Forecast Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (FRET), a forecast estimate of the amount of evapotranspiration for a well-watered reference crop (grass or alfalfa) under prescribed conditions for a 24 hour period. Weekly FRET forecast calculations and NLDAS derived reference crop ET Climatology and departure from normal are available as well. The Forecast Reference Evapotranspiration (FRET) are for a short canopy (or 12cm grasses). The short canopy ET values are calculated using the Penman-Monteith Reference Evapotranspiration Equations, adopted by the Environmental Water Resources Institute - American Society of Civil engineers (ASCE-EWRI, 2004), and the National Weather Service forecast of temperatures, relative humidity, wind, and cloud cover. This product will be issued daily by 8 am local time, year round. You can get additional information [about the dataset here](https://ams.confex.com/ams/93Annual/webprogram/Handout/Paper223261/FRET_AMS2013.pdf) and [here](https://www.weather.gov/cae/fretinfo.html).

## Earth Engine Snippet:

### Sample Code

```js
// Read in Image Collection and get single image
var fret_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine/fret/forecast/eto')
var fret_i = fret_ic.first()

// Print image to see bands
print(fret_i)

// Visualize a single image
var fret_palette = ["#ffffb2", "#fed976", "#feb24c", "#fd8d3c", "#fc4e2a", "#e31a1c", "#b10026"]
Map.addLayer(fret_i, {min:0, max:10, palette: fret_palette}, 'fret_i')
```

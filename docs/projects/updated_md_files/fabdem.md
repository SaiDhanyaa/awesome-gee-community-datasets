## Description:

FABDEM (Forest And Buildings removed Copernicus DEM) removes building and tree height biases from the Copernicus GLO 30 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (Airbus, 2020). The data is available at 1 arc second grid spacing (approximately 30m at the equator) for the globe. The authors use machine learning to
remove buildings and forests from the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model to produce, for the first time, a global map of elevation with buildings and forests removed at 1 arc second (∼30 m) grid spacing.

#### Source Data structure
The data are in Geotiff format, with each file divided into 1x1 degree tiles. Files are divided into 10x10 degree zipped folders (detailed in Data structure section below). Files are labelled using the south-west corner of the tile. For example N51E005_FABDEM_V1-0.tif has an extent from 51-52 degrees N, 5-6 degrees E.

Zipped folders are labeled with the southwest corner to northeast corner. For example For example N10E010-N20E020_FABDEM_V1-0.zip has an extent from 10-20 degrees N, 10-20 degrees E.

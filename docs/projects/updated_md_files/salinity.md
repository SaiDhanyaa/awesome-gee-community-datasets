# Global Surface water and groundwater salinity measurements (1980-2019)

## Description:

This data contains a new global salinity database, compiled from electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring data of both surface water (rivers, lakes/reservoirs) and groundwater locations over the period 1980-2019. The database includes information from over 16.3 million samples, from 45,103 surface water locations and 208,550 groundwater locations around the world.

The database consists of three categories;
1. River Data
2. Lake/Reservoir Data
3. Groundwater Data

Each category have two associated data files in csv-format, one containing the full salinity data, and one summary file currently the full salinity datasets are ingested. You can [download the dataset here](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.913939?format=html#download). You can [read the article here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0562-z)

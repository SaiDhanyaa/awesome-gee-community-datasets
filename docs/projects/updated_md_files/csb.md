# USDA Crop Sequence Boundaries 2015-2022

## Description:

The **Crop Sequence Boundaries (CSB)**, developed in collaboration with the USDA's Economic Research Service, provides estimates of field boundaries, crop acreage, and crop rotations across the contiguous United States. This dataset utilizes satellite imagery along with other public data and is open source, enabling users to conduct area and statistical analysis of planted U.S. commodities. It offers valuable insights into farmer cropping decisions and practices.

NASS required a representative field dataset for predicting crop planting based on common rotations like corn-soy, while the Economic Research Service (ERS) employs the CSB to study changes in farm management practices such as tillage and cover cropping over time. The CSB dataset represents non-confidential single crop field boundaries within a specified timeframe. It does not include personal identifying information, ownership boundaries, or tax parcels. The data is sourced from satellite imagery and publicly available information, excluding contributions from producers or agencies like the Farm Service Agency. For access and further information, you can visit the [CSB website](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/index.php).Explore the [CSB GitHub repository](https://github.com/USDA-REE-NASS/crop-sequence-boundaries/tree/main/csb-project) for the codebase, and review the [metadata](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Crop-Sequence-Boundaries/metadata_Crop-Sequence-Boundaries-2022.htm) associated with the dataset.

Crop Sequence Boundaries (CSB) represent geospatial algorithm-generated field polygons, originating from the NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL). These polygonal entities cater to the demands of applications reliant on gridded datasets, necessitating analytical units for streamlined data aggregation. The primary objective of CSBs is to furnish comprehensive coverage spanning the contiguous 48 United States, ensuring precision and replicability across multiple years. These structures are forged by amalgamating historical CDLs within a specified time frame, while also integrating road and rail networks to accurately depict crop sequences within these simulated fields. The dataset is available for 2015 to 2022 growing seasons.

#### Dataset strucutre and preprocessing
The datasets are made available as feature collections in Earth Engine for each state the 1522 reprents the year 2015-2022 growing season. The state names are part of the feature collection name. While it may not be necessary it is possible to merge them into a single collection and I created that for those would want to run some analysis on a combined feature collection.

# Harmonised global datasets of wind and solar farm locations and power

## Description:

Energy systems need decarbonisation in order to limit global warming to within safe limits. While global land planners are promising more of the planet’s limited space to wind and solar photovoltaic, there is little information on where current infrastructure is located. The majority of recent studies use land suitability for wind and solar, coupled with technical and socioeconomic constraints, as a proxy for actual location data. Here, we address this shortcoming. Using readily accessible OpenStreetMap data we present, to our knowledge, the first global, open-access, harmonised spatial datasets of wind and solar installations. We also include user friendly code to enable users to easily create newer versions of the dataset. Finally, we include first order estimates of power capacities of installations. We anticipate these data will be of widespread interest within global studies of the future potential and trade-offs associated with the global decarbonisation of energy systems.

Data adapted or built on OpenStreetMap data are required to be distributed under the same licence. These data are therefore made available under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL). Personal figshare accounts cannot currently present data under this licence so the data are currently (incorrectly) presented under a CC0 licence as a stopgap until this changes.

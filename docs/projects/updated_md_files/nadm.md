# North American Drought Monitor (NADM)

## Description:

The North American Drought Monitor (NADM) raster dataset is produced by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). This dataset is a gridded version of the North American Drought Monitor (NADM) produced by Canadian, Mexican and US authors where for each 2.5-km gridcell, the value is given by the current NADM drought classification for that region is:

Drought categories are coded as the following values in the images:

* NoData Value = -1 = no drought or wet
* 0 = abnormal dry
* 1 = moderate drought
* 2 = severe drought
* 3 = extreme drought
* 4 = exceptional drought

```js
// Read in Image Collection and mosaic to single image
var nadm_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine/nadm/monthly')
var nadm_i = nadm_ic.first()

// Print image to see bands
print(nadm_i)

// Visualize a single image
var nadm_palette = ["#ffffff", "#ffff00", "#fcd37f", "#ffaa00", "#e60000", "#730000"]
Map.addLayer(nadm_i, {min:-1, max:4, palette: nadm_palette}, 'nadm_i')

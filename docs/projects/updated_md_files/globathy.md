# GLOBathy (Global lakes bathymetry dataset)

## Description:

We developed a novel GLObal Bathymetric (GLOBathy) dataset of 1.4+â€‰million waterbodies to align with the well-established global dataset, HydroLAKES. GLOBathy uses a GIS-based framework to generate bathymetric maps based on the waterbody maximum depth estimates and HydroLAKES geometric/geophysical attributes of the waterbodies. The maximum depth estimates are validated at 1,503 waterbodies, making use of several observed data sources.

We also provide estimations for head-Area-Volume (h-A-V) relationships of the HydroLAKES waterbodies, driven from the bathymetric maps of the GLOBathy dataset. The h-A-V relationships provide essential information for water balance and hydrological studies of global waterbody systems.

# Global Database of Cement Production Assets

## Description:

The Global Database of Cement Production Assets provides information on global cement production plants that are operational today. The database contains 3,117 cement plants with exact geolocation and provides information about ownership, production type, plant type, capacity and production start year where available.

The process consists of three steps: the mixing of limestone with other materials; the heating of the limestone mixture to produce clinker and the grinding of clinker with different ingredients to produce cement. The grinding process can happen in integrated facilities where the clinker is also produced or in independent grinding facilities closer to its end market. While the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production stem from clinker production and integrated facilities, the database covers both integrated as well as independent grinding facilities.

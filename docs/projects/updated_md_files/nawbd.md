# High-Res water body dataset for tundra and boreal forests North America

## Description:

This represents a water body dataset for the North American high latitudes (WBD-NAHL). Nearly 6.5 million water bodies were identified, with
approximately 6 million (∼90 %) of them smaller than 0.1 km2. The dataset provides area and morphological attributes for every water body. During
this study, we developed an automated approach for detecting surface water extent and identifying water bodies in the 10 m resolution Sentinel-2
multispectral satellite data to enhance the capability of delineating small water bodies and their morphological attributes. The approach was
applied to the Sentinel-2 data acquired in 2019 to produce the water body dataset for the entire tundra and boreal forests in North America. The
dataset provided a more complete representation of the region than existing regional datasets for North America, e.g., Permafrost Region Pond and
Lake (PeRL). The total accuracy of the detected water extent by the WBD-NAHL dataset was 96.36 % through comparison to interpreted data for
locations randomly sampled across the region. The original data source is from the [National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center](https://doi.org/10.11888/Hydro.tpdc.271021).

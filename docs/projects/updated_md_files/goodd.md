# Global georeferenced Database of Dams(GOODD)

## Description:

GOODD, a global dataset of more than 38,000 georeferenced dams as well as their associated catchments. The source [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0362-5) presents the development of the global database through systematic digitisation of satellite imagery globally by a small team and highlights the various approaches to bias estimation and to validation of the data. The following datasets are provided (a) raw digitised coordinates for the location of dam walls (that may be useful for example in machine learning approaches to dam identification from imagery), (b) a global vector file of the watershed for each dam.

# RealSAT Global Dataset of Reservoir and Lake Surface Area

## Description:

RealSAT presents a new global dataset that contains the location and surface area variations of 681,137 lakes and reservoirs larger than 0.1 square kilometers (and south of 50 degree N) from 1984 to 2015, to enable the study of the impact of human actions and climate change on freshwater availability. Within its scope for size and region covered, this dataset is far more comprehensive than existing datasets such as HydroLakes. The static subset of the dataset was ingested rather than timeseries since there was transformation issues however the [dataset can be downloaded here.](https://zenodo.org/record/6468209). A reattempt might be made in the future to ingest the timeseries files.

You can read the paper here : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01449-5 and a [viewer is made available to look at an online copy of the data](http://umnlcc.cs.umn.edu/realsat/)

# Global Database of Iron and Steel Production Assets

## Description:

The Global Database of Iron and Steel Production Assets provides information on global iron and steel production plants that are operational today. The database contains 1,598 production plants with exact geolocation and provides information about ownership, production type, plant type, capacity and production start year where available.

Primary steel production processes (blast furnace, basic oxygen furnace or open-hearth furnaces), typically use coal as an energy source and take place in large integrated facilities. Whereas secondary steel production processes (electric arc furnaces) typically use electricity as an energy source and take place in so called ‘mini-mills’. The database captures a wide range of assets across the steel production process, including the procurement and processing of raw materials (in particular coking and pelletisation plants), the production of crude steel (integrated plants and mini-mills) and the production of finished steel products (downstream plants).

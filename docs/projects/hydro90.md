## Description:

The Hydrography 90 layers uses the MERIT Hydro digital elevation model at 3 arcsec (∼ 90 m at the Equator) to derive a globally seamless, standardised hydrographic network, the "Hydrography90m", with corresponding stream topographic and topological information. A central feature of
the network is the minimal upstream contributing area, i.e. flow accumulation, of 0.05 km2 (or 5 ha) to initiate a stream channel, which allowed us to extract headwater stream channels in great detail.

The data validation procedures confirmed Hydrography90m as a more accurate representation of stream networks compared to HydroRIVERS, GRWL, and MERIT
Hydro–Vector. Improved accuracy was achieved principally by employing a higher resolution DEM, the MD8 flow routing algorithm, and a markedly smaller flow accumulation threshold to initiate stream channels. With these characteristics, Hydrography90m provides a valuable basis for supporting a variety of freshwater-related research disciplines. Find additional details [in the paper here](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4525/2022/essd-14-4525-2022.pdf). The datasets can [be downloaded here](https://hydrography.org/hydrography90m/hydrography90m_layers/). This is one of the highest resolution global hydrography datasets and has multiple applications.

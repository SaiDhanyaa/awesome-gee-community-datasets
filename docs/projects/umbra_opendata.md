## Description:

Umbra satellites generate the highest resolution SAR imagery ever offered commercially from space (better than 25 cm / 10 inches). SAR satellites can capture images at night, through cloud cover, smoke and rain. SAR is unique in its abilities to monitor changes. The Open Data Program (ODP) monitors ten diverse locations around the world. Updated frequently with new images. ODP enables users to analyze the time-series data to detect changes in each location.

#### Data subset
Only GEC data was selected from the available collections since they were already encoded as geotiffs. SAR GEC data is a geocoded product flattened to a single elevation to reduce visual distortions. It is analysis-ready, though it also contains layover and foreshortening.SAR GEC data is often taken as a post product processed from slant or ground range radar images. It contains amplitude information only.

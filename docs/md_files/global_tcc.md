## Description:

The Global 30m Landsat Tree Canopy Version 4 (TCC) product is a 30-meter resolution dataset that shows tree canopy coverage per pixel between 0% and
100%. The TCC product was announced in May 2019 and was processed from the Landsat image archive. It replaces the previous version of global tree
canopy cover estimates for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. It also includes annual tree cover estimates from 2010 to 2015 for North and South America.
The TCC datasets are based on Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. The most recent TCC version 2021.4 product suite released in 2023 includes several
components, including an annual Science product with maps and data for years 2008-2021. You can find [additional information here]() and download the [datasets here](https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MEASURES/GFCC30TC.003/)

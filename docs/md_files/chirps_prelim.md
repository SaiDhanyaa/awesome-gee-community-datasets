## Description:

The Climate Hazards Center InfraRed Precipitation With Station Data-Prelim (CHIRPS-Prelim) is a blend of CHIRPS data with in situ precipitation data
to unbias the data and enhance its accuracy. The process of generating CHIRPS- Prelim is similar to the CHIRPS process, with the main difference
being its reliance on Global Telecommunication System (GTS) stations only, which are available in near-real time. Blending of CHIRP with GTS-only
stations allows for the latency of CHIRPS- Prelim to be <5 days. Note that, in general, the differences in CHIRPS-Prelim and CHIRPS are within
acceptable limits, as both data sets share the same climatological mean. You can find additional [information here](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) and [on climate org dataset page here](https://support.climateengine.org/article/53-chirps).

This dataset is to be used in conjunction with CHIRPS Pentad/Daily collections, which are Earth Engine assets at:
- UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/PENTAD

- UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY

### Sample Code
```js
// Read in Image Collections and get single image
var chirps_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/ce-chirps-prelim-pentad')
var chirps_i = chirps_ic.first()

// Print single image to see bands
print(chirps_i)

// Visualize precipitation for single image
var prec_palette = ["#ffffcc", "#c7e9b4", "#7fcdbb", "#41b6c4", "#1d91c0", "#225ea8", "#0c2c84"]
Map.addLayer(chirps_i.select('precipitation'), {min: 0, max: 200, palette: prec_palette}, 'precipitation')

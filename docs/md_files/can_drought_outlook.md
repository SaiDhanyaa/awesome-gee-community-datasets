## Description:

The Canadian Drought Outlook raster dataset is produced by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). The Canadian Drought Outlook predicts whether drought across Canada will emerge, stay the same or get better over the target month. In calculating the outlook, consideration is given to Agroclimate indices, such as the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The drought outlook is issued on the first Thursday of each calendar month and is valid for 32 days from that date. You can get additional information about [this dataset here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/2c82daab-f6d9-4b19-96b5-238249e09fb9) and on the [climate engine org dataset page here](https://support.climateengine.org/article/91-can-drought).

// Read in Image Collection and get single image
var cdo_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/ce-aafc-cdo-monthly')
var cdo_i = cdo_ic.first()

// Print image to see bands
print(cdo_i)

// Visualize a single image
var cdo_palette = ["#ffffff", "#4a7733", "#dfb73d", "#b6a083", "#775412", "#c24d1b"]

## Description:

The High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) provides useful numerical simulations of temperature over large areas. Climate Engine is ingesting only the band containing temperature at 2m above ground level, but HRDPS also produces bands for precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, humidity, and others. These numerical simulations can be used for air quality modeling and forecasting, climate and wildfire modeling, and extreme weather forecasting. Users who will benefit most from using these new data are those for whom a detailed forecast of surface temperatures and winds is important. The 2.5 km forecasts could add much value especially during the change of seasons and in wintertime when rapid changes in temperature and winds cause phase transitions of precipitation (freezing rain to snow to rain for example). HRDPS is the high resolution counterpart to the RDPS dataset. You can additional [information here](https://weather.gc.ca/grib/grib2_HRDPS_HR_e.html) and on the [climate engine org dataset page](https://support.climateengine.org/article/68-hrdps).

## Earth Engine Snippet:

### Sample Code

```js
// Read in Image Collection and get first image
var hrdps_ic = ee.ImageCollection('projects/climate-engine-pro/assets/ce-hrdps-daily')
var hrdps_i = hrdps_ic.first()

// Print first image to see bands
print(hrdps_i)

// Visualize temperature from first image
var temp_palette = ["#b2182b", "#ef8a62", "#fddbc7", "#f7f7f7", "#d1e5f0", "#67a9cf", "#2166ac"].reverse()
Map.addLayer(hrdps_i.select('Tavg'), {min: -10, max: 20, palette: temp_palette}, 'Tavg')
```


# Global database of cement production assets and upstream suppliers

## Description

The Global Cement Production Dynamics dataset provides a comprehensive asset-level view of the cement industry, addressing the growing climate and
sustainability concerns faced by cement producers and investors. It integrates greenhouse gas emissions disclosure, sourcing patterns of raw
materials, and the age of production plants as key variables. Leveraging innovative techniques, including geospatial computer vision and Large
Language Modelling, the dataset offers a holistic understanding of global cement production dynamics. It serves various applications, such as
environmental impact assessment, investment decision-making, industry research, and policy development, contributing to more informed and
responsible decision-making within the sector.

The dataset contains spatial information for 3,117 cement production assets, offering near-approximate location data within a 10-kilometer radius.
This data, available for download in Excel format from the Dryad Repository, includes precise coordinates (WGS84), city, state, country, ISO codes,
sub-region, and region, obtained through reverse geocoding. Plant-specific details encompass plant type (integrated or grinding), production process
(wet or dry), capacity, and the year of production commencement, with corresponding sources for capacity data. Ownership information is also
comprehensive, encompassing direct or subsidiary owner names, ultimate parent details, PermID where available, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI),
holding status (public or private), ticker, and exchange for ultimate parents. In cases of joint ventures, information for both ultimate parents is
provided, alongside source links for ownership data. You can [read the paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02599-w).

#### Dataset structure
The datasets were renamed to end with the date of [dataset upload to Dryad Repository](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6t1g1jx4f) and the primary layer consisting of the assets database includes the following fields. You can expand this section to get all field names or use the example code

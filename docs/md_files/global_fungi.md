## Description:

Fungi are essential components of ecosystems, contributing to vital functions such as carbon cycling, decomposition, plant associations, and pathogenicity. However, our knowledge of fungal biogeography and the factors driving these patterns is limited. To address this gap, we compiled and validated data on soil fungal communities from terrestrial environments, including soil and plant-associated habitats. This valuable dataset, available through the user interface at https://globalfungi.com, encompasses over 600 million observations of fungal sequences derived from more than 17,000 samples, with precise geographic information and metadata from 178 original studies. The dataset, which includes millions of unique nucleotide sequences of the fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2, represents an extensive atlas of global fungal distribution. It is designed to facilitate the integration of third-party data, promoting further exploration and enhancing our understanding of fungal biogeography and its environmental drivers.

#### Dataset preprocessing
Feature field were transformed to make sure it meets the limits for characters. The overall global extract was created from globalfungi.com and converted to a shapefile. Changes are

```
'year_of_sampling': 'sample_yr'
'ITS1_extracted': 'ITS1_extr',
'ITS3_extracted': 'ITS2_extr'

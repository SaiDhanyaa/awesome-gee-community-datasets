## Description:

Landsat-based forest area consistent with FAO definitions for Canada's forested ecosystems. To conform with international reporting guidelines and programs, using Landsat data we map the forest area for Canada following the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) definition. The FAO definition incorporates land use, whereby trees removed by fire and harvesting for instance, remain forest as the trees will return. Annually representative maps were produced using over three decades of annual land cover data generated from Landsat derived time series land cover and change information (to generate a spatially explicit estimate of the forest area of Canada in 2019). We mapped the area of 'forest', as defined by the FAO, for Canada's 650 Mha of forested ecozones. The map includes the current forest cover in a given year (i.e. 2019), plus the satellite-based temporally informed forest area where tree cover had been temporarily lost due to fire or harvest. See [Wulder et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpaa006) for an overview of the methods, data, image processing, as well as information on accuracy assessment using Canadaâ€™s National Inventory (NFI).

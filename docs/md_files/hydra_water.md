## Description:

This dataset is a surface water output image from the Hydrologic Remote Sensing Analysis for Floods (HYDRAFloods) system utilizing a Deep Learning TensorFlow approach. Specifically, this Joint Research Centre (JRC) Adjusted Learning Rate Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Dice model and methodology are discussed in detail in the recent [Deep learning approach for Sentinel-1 surface water mapping leveraging Google Earth Engine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667393221000053#!) publication.

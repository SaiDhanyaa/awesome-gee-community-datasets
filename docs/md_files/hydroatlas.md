## Description:

HydroATLAS offers a global compendium of hydro-environmental characteristics for all sub-basins of HydroBASINS, all river reaches of HydroRIVERS, and all lake polygons of HydroLAKES. The HydroATLAS database is divided into three distinct sub-datasets: BasinATLAS, RiverATLAS, and LakeATLAS which represent sub-basin delineations (polygons), the river network (lines), and lake shorelines (polygons), respectively. In total, HydroATLAS contains 1.0 million sub-basins, 8.5 million river reaches, and 1.4 million lakes.

HydroATLAS has been created by compiling and re-formatting a wide range of hydro-environmental attributes derived from existing global datasets in a consistent and organized manner. The resulting data compendium offers attributes grouped in seven categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover & use; soils & geology; and anthropogenic influences. For each of the three sub-datasets, HydroATLAS contains 56 hydro-environmental variables, partitioned into 281 individual attributes. You can download [the files here](https://www.hydrosheds.org/hydroatlas)

The HydroATLAS database is distributed in large file sizes due to the enriched attribute information. Users who only need geometric information and digital vector maps of sub-basin boundaries, river network lines, and lake shorelines may prefer to download the HydroBASINS, HydroRIVERS, or HydroLAKES products instead.

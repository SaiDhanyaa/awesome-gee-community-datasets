## Description:

This geospatial dataset encompasses crucial biophysical parameters, namely Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), indispensable for characterizing terrestrial ecosystems. The dataset addresses the limitations observed in existing global LAI/FPAR products, including challenges related to spatial-temporal coherence and accuracy.

Drawing from a range of long-term global LAI/FPAR products, including MODIS&VIIRS, this dataset facilitates a comprehensive analysis of vegetation dynamics and their interplay with climate change. Developed as a Sensor-Independent (SI) LAI/FPAR Climate Data Record (CDR), this dataset is derived from Terra-MODIS, Aqua-MODIS, and VIIRS LAI/FPAR standard products.

Encompassing a substantial temporal scope spanning from 2000 to 2022, the SI LAI/FPAR CDR provides valuable insights at various spatial resolutions: 500 meters, 5 kilometers, and 0.05 degrees. Its temporal granularity includes 8-day intervals and bimonthly frequency. To facilitate diverse analyses and applications, this dataset is accessible in both sinusoidal and WGS1984 projections. It represents a comprehensive and refined resource for studying terrestrial ecosystems and their response to climate dynamics.

## Description:

The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset is a geocoded extension of a selection of natural disasters from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' (CRED) Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The data set encompasses 39,953 locations for 9,924 disasters that occurred worldwide in the years 1960 to 2018. All floods, storms (typhoons, monsoons etc.), earthquakes, landslides, droughts, volcanic activity and extreme temperatures that were recorded in EM-DAT during these 58 years and could be geocoded are included in the data set. The highest spatial resolution in the data set corresponds to administrative level 3 (usually district/commune/village) in the Global Administrative Areas database (GADM, 2018). The vast majority of the locations are administrative level 1 (typically state/province/region). You can access the dataset from [NASA SEDAC](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/pend-gdis-1960-2018) and read the [full paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00846-6)

# Climate Trace Global Emissions Data

## Description:

Climate TRACE is a non-profit coalition that has unveiled an open emissions database containing more than 352 million assets. The database provides a comprehensive accounting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based primarily on direct, independent observation. It includes every country and territory in the world and covers various emitting activities such as energy production, industrial processes, and land use. The data are derived from satellites, remote sensing, and other public and commercial sources, making it the most comprehensive and granular dataset of recent GHG emissions ever created. The inventory allows for transparent assessment of each country's progress toward emission reduction goals.

For more detailed information, you can visit the Climate TRACE website at [climatetrace.org](https://climatetrace.org).

#### Dataset preprocessing

The downloaded datasets were processed to get system:time_start and system:time_end in epoch time and these were added to the data column in GEE. Each sector and their associated emissions dataset sources were processed providing 38,731,650 total features. Not all sectors had emissions locations and some were provided only at a country level.

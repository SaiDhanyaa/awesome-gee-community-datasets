## Description:

Daylight is a complete distribution of global, open map data that’s freely available with support from community and professional mapmakers. We combine the work of global contributors to projects like OpenStreetMap with quality and consistency checks from Daylight mapping partners to create a free, stable, and easy-to-use street-scale global map. Daylight Map Distribution will include a new dataset consisting of vectorized landcover features derived from the European Space Agency’s 2020 World Cover (10m) rasters. This dataset provides global coverage and is suitable for use in maps up to 1:1 million (zoom level 8).

#### Dataset structure
Dataset releases are created by the team periodically and will be ingested accordingly into the GEE collection.

## Description:

The Global Channel Belt (GCB) datasets describes the global extent of river channel belts. A two-tier single-threaded (e.g., meandering) versus multi-threaded (e.g., braided) classification is provided showing the likely morphology of the associated active river channel. In addition, the GCB model provides a new global classification of riverine and lacustrine environments based on the mapped extent of the river channel belts.

To read more about the dataset check out the Nature Communications article [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37852-8). The datasets are also publically available on the Zenodo data repository [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7680163#.ZD_QEnZBw2w).

#### GCB Datasets

* Band 'Meandering' - % confidence that a pixel is single-threaded (0 to 100%)
* Band 'Braided' - % confidence that a pixel is multi-threaded (0 to 100%)

The combined value of the 'Meandering' and 'Braided' bands yield the confidence of the channel belt extent. The remaining percentage out of a total 100, is the confidence that a pixel is classified as background (or non riverine).

## Description:

The GEBCO_2023 Grid is a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation data in meters on a 15 arc-second interval grid. This means that the grid has a spatial resolution of about 1 kilometer at the equator. The data values are pixel-center registered, meaning that they refer to the elevation at the center of each grid cell.

The grid is accompanied by a Type Identifier (TID) Grid, which provides information on the types of source data that the GEBCO_2023 Grid is based on. The primary GEBCO_2023 grid contains land and ice surface elevation information. A version is also made available with under-ice topography/bathymetry information for Greenland and Antarctica.

The GEBCO_2023 Grid was published in April 2023 and is the fifth GEBCO grid developed through the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. This is a collaborative project between the Nippon Foundation of Japan and GEBCO, which aims to bring together all available bathymetric data to produce the definitive map of the world ocean floor and make it available to all. The GEBCO_2023 Grid is a valuable resource for a variety of applications, including oceanography, geology, marine biology, climate change research, and disaster management.For information on the data sets included in the GEBCO_2021 Grid, please see the [list of contributions included in this release of the grid.](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/)
